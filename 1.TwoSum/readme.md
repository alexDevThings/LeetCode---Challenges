# LeetCode Solutions Repository âœ¨

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! Here you'll find my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in Java.
 I continuously update this repository as I work through new challenges and refine my solutions.

## Repository Structure
Each problem is contained in its own folder (e.g., `TwoSum`) and typically includes:
- `Solution.java`: The Java solution to the problem.
- Additional notes or documentation as needed.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexDevThings/LeetCode---Challenges 

2. Navigate to the folder of the problem you're interested in.
3. Open and run the Java solution using your preferred IDE or via the command line.
